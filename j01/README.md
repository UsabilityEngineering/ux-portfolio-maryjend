# j01 - The Downfall of the Apple TV Remote

In my family’s home we use the Apple TV console and remote. Typically we find all Apple products to be seemingly easy to use and consistent with each other. We made the switch to Apple TV from AT&T. The Apple TV remote is very unique, mainly due to its small size, lack of many usual buttons, and the use of a trackpad.

Because the Apple TV has very few buttons, and a trackpad, the **learnability** was very quick. When using a TV remote, my goal is to be able to easily switch from app to app, channel to channel, navigate to the main menu, navigate to my library, go back, etc.. Typically, remotes become something a typical user (me) can use without looking at each button for every command. 

However, the Apple TV remote fails the user with the button named “Menu”. The Apple TV remote has poor **consistency and standards** here. Typically, with a remote or ‘menu’ command, the user expects to be taken to the main menu, or a home screen. This is not the case for the Apple TV “Menu” button. When first using the remote while being inside an app, I expected the “Menu” button to take me to said app’s menu or sidebar. In reality, I was just taken back a step to the field I was previously in. The “Menu” button actually only acts as a “back” button. In most cases, with competing remotes the back button is illustrated as a curved arrow, signifying moving back one step, or simply the word “back”.  

As a user, this quickly becomes frustrating, no matter how equipped I become with the remote. If I were to want see a menu, or reach the Apple TV home/menu, I would need to utilize the button next to the “Menu” button. This button has an image of a small monitor/screen. This is another example of poor **consistency and standards**. Never before have I seen another remote with a similar button image. 

Because both of these buttons have created frustration, the user (me) has been turned off from using it. I also had wished there was **help and documentation** provided with the remote. As we know, a desire for help and documentation is not necessarily a good thing when it comes to a product, especially when the user has not felt this way about competing products.
